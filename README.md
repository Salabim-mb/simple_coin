### Introduction
Simple Coin is a project based on blockchain technology. It allows
its users to securely connect with others, without any centralized
supervisor. Given that, user can be sure that his privacy is put as
the top priority.

### How it works
Our project is using mechanism of digital signature verification, which
is provided by ECDSA algorithm, based on elliptic curves. With that
kind of sophisticated solution it is possible to verify author of the
message among all messages (very often junky) received.

### Tech stack
Project is created in Flask Framework (runnning on Python 3.+) and it's using following libraries:
- gunicorn
- requests
- cryptography
- pycryptodome
- ecdsa
