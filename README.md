### Introduction
Simple Coin is a project based on blockchain technology. It allows
its users to securely connect with others, without any centralized
supervisor. Given that, user can be sure that his privacy is put as
the top priority.

### How it works
Our project is using mechanism of digital signature verification, which
is provided by ECDSA algorithm, based on elliptic curves. With that
kind of sophisticated solution it is possible to verify author of the
message among all transactions (very often junky) received. Candidates that are verified with correct
signature and data can be then added to blockchain. Blockchain can also be fetched for lookup by any user (it is an assurance of transparency).

### Tech stack
Project is created in Flask Framework (runnning on Python 3.+) and it's using following libraries:
- gunicorn
- requests
- cryptography
- pycryptodome
- base64
- random
- ecdsa
